<p>Should a great and commercial People
experience an unlooked for reverse of
fortune; should a rapid decay of Trade, a
long protracted and ruinous War, an expenditure
of the Public Money, at once lavish
and unnecessary, should even all these causes
conspire with an oppressive national debt,
in reducing them from opulence and prosperity
to the lowest ebb of distress, the
consequences must be melancholy and alarming:
On one hand, the People, impatient
of this calamitous change, will murmur against
Government, and proceed to disorderly and
tumultuous Insurrections. On the other,
Administration, foreseeing danger to its own
permanence and safety, will perhaps, adopt
coercive measures, not altogether consistent
with the liberty of its subjects:—Under these
circumstances, every well intentioned mind
will be deeply affected with concern, for
the welfare of his country; various means
will be recommended of healing its disorders,
or, at least, of mitigating their virulence; and
no one can be reprehensible in proposing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Remedy, or an alteration, even, though the
success be doubtful:—Influenced by such
considerations, we also appeal to the indulgence
of a generous Public, and should the
application we offer prove beneficial, the
utmost wish of our heart will be gratified,
should it, on the contrary, be neglected or
derided, the consciousness of an upright intention,
must in some measure console us.</p>

<p>An Antidote has been already prescribed
by a Revd. Baronet, we presume with the
same view; the application of which, however,
in our opinion, would tend to cherish
the malignancy of the disease, rather than
to eradicate its cause:—Wherefore, alarmed
for the constitution of the patient, should
it be adopted, and at the same time, though
we acknowledge and applaud the Revd.
Author’s anxiety in this case, suspecting that
he would prefer a partial to a complete
Restoration, we humbly beg leave to state
our reasons for differing in sentiment with a
man of his consummate knowledge and experience,
together with our objections to his
Antidote.</p>

<p>That the present crisis is an alarming one,
every man capable of reflection, will readily
admit, that, however, every artifice of audacity
and craft has been exerted (and with
success exerted) to undermine the religious,
moral, and political sentiments of the great
mass of the manufacturing and agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
orders of Society in England, seems to require
some farther proof, than the mere
assertion of the Author, before we can assent
to it, with an equal degree of conviction:—Is
it probable that, notwithstanding the
firmness which has so eminently distinguished
the present Administration, such artifices
should be resorted to with impunity?
Is it possible that success should attend such
artifices, notwithstanding the vigilance of
Ministers, so unhesitatingly displayed in the
removal of Lord Fitzwilliam? Perhaps, the
Revd. Author meant obliquely to censure
Administration, for overlooking such attempts
in the first instance, and subsequently, for
not foreseeing and guarding against their
pernicious effects, for not suppressing tumultuous
assemblies, when, (according to his
assertion) the then existing laws, were of
sufficient force to stamp the greater part of
them with the Seal of illegality.</p>

<p>It is a melancholy consideration, that
the Christian Religion, which inculcates
universal good will and beneficence, as the
peculiar doctrine of its founder, should have
been not unfrequently perverted, in consequence
of the self-interested and prejudiced
views of individuals, into an instrument of
cruelty and oppression; and it is probable
that this perversion should have an influence,
in bringing into disrepute the Religion
we profess, (which is meant we presume,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
by the overthrow of our God) far more prevalent
than the effusions of impiety and
atheism, however circulated in private, or
openly and daringly boasted of;—The pure
and simple precepts of Christianity call forth
our utmost admiration, the sanctity and
beneficence of its founder, excite in us reverence
and love, can then these impious
and atheistical dogmas (inspiring us but with
horror) can these dogmas it may be asked,
counteract the influence of the Religion in
which we have been educated, which we
have been taught, and which we are inclined
from its pure morality to respect? It is the
abuse of Christianity, its pretended friends,
not its open and avowed antagonists, that
will ever abridge its permanence or diffusion.</p>

<p>Power, wealth, and consequence, are the
prime motives of human exertion, and when
once in possession of these objects, men are
equally anxious to preserve, as they originally
were to acquire them:—the establishment
of Hierarchies is of human invention,
and of course, must partake in the imperfections
of humanity; These Hierarchies
vest in the several members composing them,
no small share of profit and authority, to
retain which, is their common interest; whenever
the particular tenets, for the maintenance
of which, the establishment was
originally formed, are called in question,
its members, alarmed at the impending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
danger, resort to every means in their power,
of upholding their own, and of repelling the
influence of their assailants, among which,
persecution may perhaps appear a ready and
effectual mode of quelling all opposition.</p>

<p>The Church of Rome exceeded all other
Hierarchies in extent of Dominion, of Power,
and of Influence; its exertions, therefore,
against all assailants would be proportionably
vigorous, its persecutions proportionably
extensive:—these assertions are not advanced
with the view of vindicating Persecution,
they are meant merely to account, in some
measure, for its origin;—convinced that the
God of Mercy can delight only in Virtue
and Integrity, every reflecting mind must
abhor and condemn the mistaken zeal of
those, who think they promote the service of
the Divinity, by torturing and afflicting his
creatures:—but have the members of the
Protestant Establishment entirely abstained
from the exercise of this instrument, to
establish or confirm their Power? Are
they, altogether, innocent of resorting to
this object of their reprehension? For a
solution of these questions we may recur
to our own domestic annals. Has not the
bulk of the Irish Nation been subject to the
will and caprice of a few individuals (in
comparison with its population) and this,
for adhering to the religion of their forefathers?—Have
not the ministers of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
religion (after being compelled to seek their
education in some foreign country) been
debarred from the exercise of their sacred
functions except by stealth or privacy?—Have
not the adherents to this Religion been
shackled in every effort to better their condition?—Have
they not been rendered
incapable of acquiring real property?—If
possessed of such property, have they not
been subject to its entire forfeiture by information
or discovery?—Were not such forfeitures
intended to act as allurements for
children to inform, even, against their own
parents?—Was not every father of a family
liable to punishment for educating his children,
in that religious persuasion, which he
esteemed the only true one?—Were not
Catholics ineligible to any office of power
or trust?—Were not these Acts in force for
nearly a century?—Many other grievances,
equally oppressive in addition to these,
were inflicted on them in direct violation of
the Treaty of Limerick, in which it was stipulated,
that the Irish should be admissible
to all the Privileges of subjects, upon taking
the oath of Allegiance, without being bound
to take the oath of Supremacy:—our domestic
annals, then, afford a strong presumption
that the Protestant Establishment has
been no less culpable, in the exercise of
persecution, as an instrument to support its
power, than the Romish Hierarchy so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
inveighed against; whilst its present conduct,
in still withholding from the Catholics
a full participation in the privileges to which
its Protestant Subjects are admitted, is a convincing
proof that it continues actuated by
a spirit of intolerance;—not to particularize
the absurd calumnies, the foul misrepresentations,
so vehemently urged against them,
and of which some of its ministers (we regret
to observe) are too intemperate in the
application;—strange inconsistency that
there is in mankind, when the very means
they severely reprehend, are not frequently
applied by themselves.—Can it be supposed,
that men of well cultivated understandings,
should be so lost to all sense of morality, so
destitute of respect for their own characters,
as to look upon wilful perjury as a virtue,
when resorted to for particular purposes,
or particular interests?—Can it be admitted
that men, many of them eye witnesses of, and
sufferers in the late revolutionary calamities
on the Continent, when they return home
should, by the most atrocious of crimes,
voluntarily endanger the peace and tranquility
of their native Country? Their own
conduct is a full refutation of the calumnious
charges advanced against them, a positive
proof that they seriously regard their moral
obligations;—they are, not only, peaceable
in their own demeanor,—they render the
people, of whom they are the pastors, quiet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
and inoffensive;—were they disposed to
estimate wilful perjury as venial, or, in some
particular instances, as laudable, they would
recommend it to their several flocks, and
thus, would the Catholics, by being freed
from the restraint of morality, become admissible
to all the privileges of subjects; but
it is the part, only, of an abandoned profligate,
to profess his conformity with the
established doctrines, and to violate the most
solemn engagements, for the advancement
of his own private interest or ambition;—the
man of integrity disclaims all compromise
with his conscience, he will submit
to every privation, and will encounter indigence
and obscurity, rather than deserve
the imputation of guilt:—the express denial
of the Catholic Universities that any earthly
power can grant absolution for perjury, the
solemn abjuration of such a doctrine by the
Priesthood themselves, but above all, the
uniform tenor of their conduct, proves that
these calumnies are altogether unfounded.</p>

<p>National reflections, it has been observed,
are not justified in theory, nor on any general
principles;—the same observation will hold
good in regard to Sects, Parties, or Professions:—particular
individuals may, undoubtedly,
be just objects of censure, particular
tenets of reprehension, but indiscriminate
abuse, is the offspring of prejudice or
malevolence, it can never derive its origin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
from sober reason and impartiality.—To follow
the author of the Antidote through his
abusive rhapsody against the Schismatics,
would, perhaps, engage us too far in scurrility,
to examine into the tenets, he attributes
to them, will, at least, more usefully
employ our attention. A new sect has been
lately formed, the constitution of whose
church, he says, instructs its adherents that,
through belief, they will escape from the
guilt and punishment of sin; this proposition,
advanced as one of the tenets of the new
sect, is scarcely intelligible;—that a due portion
of belief will exonerate us from the
punishment of sin, may be readily understood,
however we may doubt of its truth,
but that the commission of sin will not involve
us in guilt, is a proposition that cannot
without difficulty be comprehended. The
Revd. Author may mean perhaps, that they
maintain faith to be more meritorious than
good works, a doctrine which has been ascribed
to many of the sectaries, but, as it is not
included by him who founded our Religion,
among the immediate requisites for salvation,
it ought to be examined with the utmost
caution, and, if upon such an examination,
it should appear disadvantageous to the interest
of society, it ought at once to be rejected—according
to this tenet, its adherents
are not required to cultivate those good qualities,
which are beneficial to mankind; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
neglect the occasions of beneficence, they
lose even the dispositions of benevolence,
in cultivating faith, which quality above all
others, will insure their acceptance with God.
They expose themselves to the frauds of
knaves, or the errors of fanatics, into which
frauds and errors however, they dare not
examine, as to doubt, is to fail in that essential
point, on which they found their future
hope;—under the influence likewise of
this principle, the tenor of their conduct becomes
a matter of no moment, it induces
negligence in regard to their duties, as men
in a state of society, since active virtue can
be of no avail, where faith is esteemed the sole
requisite for justification:—a less grave argument
also, though upon so serious a subject,
may, perhaps, be not inapplicable. Faith
depends upon ignorance, of course the less
a man knows, the more he has to believe,
hence the most ignorant, with a due supply
of credulity, will become the most meritorious
of christians:—we would moreover, recommend
it to the Revd. Author, of the Antidote,
to examine more accurately into his own
Articles of Belief, as required by law, before
he censures this doctrine of the Sectaries.</p>

<p>They hold, moreover, as the Rev. Author informs
us, farther, that, if once justified, no outrage
they can afterwards commit, no sin (it
does not signify of how horrible a nature, they
can be guilty of) will deprive them of eternal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
salvation;—We readily join with Sir Harcourt
Lees in reprobating such a tenet, it is
absurd and presumptuous;—The determinations
of God are impenetrable by man;—his
acceptance of our feeble efforts to conciliate
his favor, can be discovered only by the Revelation
he has communicated.—How then
can we become confident in our own justification,
during our present state of existence,
in which we are unceasingly liable to error?
The very supposition involves in it an absurdity;—but
to arrogate to ourselves exemption
from punishment for all future transgressions,
is to assume the peculiar province
of the Deity, and is equally impious, as it is
presumptuous;—this tenet is also subversive
of general Benevolence,—its votaries must,
necessarily, look upon themselves as the sole
partakers in justification, and the rest of
mankind as outcasts from God’s Mercy.
They will esteem them, therefore, but little
entitled to their consideration and regard;—the
conceit of being justified must originate
either in actual, or fancied inspiration, but
inspiration is a real feeling of the Divine Presence,
enthusiasm a false one, and the effects
are nearly the same in either case,—how then
will they guard themselves from misapprehension?
how will they be able to distinguish
between Divine Inspiration, and mere
mortal enthusiasm?—The former will, we
must acknowledge, dissipate all doubt, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
confirm them in virtue, but the latter may
lead them into errors, which it will be difficult,
if not impossible to repair:—may not
these tenets however, be somewhat overcharged,
I do not mean by design, but
through misapprehension.—The consciousness
of a scrupulous discharge of their relative
duties may, in some instance, give birth
to presumption, and leave men to conceive
themselves entitled to justification from their
own superior merits; but these sectaries
strongly impressed with the imperfection of
human nature, attributing such conceptions
to the arrogance of human reason, regard
Faith as an humble acknowledgement of
their incompetence to merit the Divine Favor,
they rely solely on the Mercy of God for justification;—hence
their preference of faith,
in comparison with their own exertions for
this purpose;—by these means, however,
their minds became enervated, their reason
less vigorous, they are less inclined to exert
it, and more open to the fervor of enthusiasm,
which may, not improbably, inspire an
opinion, that themselves are favored with a
Divine Communication; that hypocrites and
imposters will take advantage of this disposition
is more than probable, but hypocrites
and imposters abound in all persuasions, even
in the Established Church, a good mind may
be deceived, but it is hoped will not be perverted
by them;—the absurdity of such doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
may be offered to their consideration,
convince their reason and they will abjure
them, but, if this delusion tends only to
sweeten their present enjoyments, and render
them confident in future hope, why should
they be grossly reviled for their belief?</p>

<p>“But (he proceeds) should these schismatics
form a Coalition with the sworn enemies
of our Church and constitution, the
pious and merciful Papists (as Lord Donoughmore
calls them) whose Priests will
give them absolution, while the imaginations
of the fanatic Enthusiast will justify
him, I should be glad to know what would
soon be the fate of both Church and
King in this great Empire.” Here the Rev’d.
Author displays his motives for administering
to the public, foreseeing danger from the
envenomed shafts of the fanatic, and from
those of the Papist, armed with a still more
deadly poison, he compounds an Antidote
that he may counteract their pernicious effects,
he expresses indeed, the most decided
contempt for Dr. Dromgoole’s Prophecy,
though he evidently apprehends its accomplishment,—but
Dr. Dromgoole’s prophecy
is as harmless as himself was uninspired;
the Protestant Church may defy external violence,
her danger proceeds from her own internal
system, she cherishes, within her own bosom,
a principal of decay, which unless Correctives
be applied, must terminate in dissolution:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
The Clergy of the establishment have
been successful in their pursuit, they have
possessed themselves of the objects to which
they aspired Power, Wealth and Consequence:
but in all human affairs, the completion of
our desires is generally succeeded by inactivity,
after a successful termination of our
labours, we sit down to enjoy with ease and
tranquility, the good things of this life, so it
is with the Clergy of the establishment, their
zeal is grown luke warm, their exertions are
relaxed; In their Churches, instead of the animated
advocate infusing into his audience the
love of Religion, with admiration at its excellence,
we too frequently find an indolent drone
holding forth to a drowsy congregation: In
the conventicle, on the contrary, we may be
hold the schismatic, ardent in zeal, earnest
in his exhortations, vehement, impetuous,
and enforcing by his impressive manner, the
uninterrupted attention of his auditors:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">... Se vis me flere dolendum est</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Primum ipsi tibi....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Si dicentis erunt Fortunis absona dicta</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Romani tollent Equites Peditesque Cachinnum.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cause of this essential difference is,
that the Clergy have already attained the
summit of their ambition, whereas the Fanatic
is still engaged in the pursuit after profit
and estimation:—should it be represented
that, with respect to the establishment, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
are gradations in preferment, and dignities,
with princely endowments, sufficient to excite
emulation even in the most indolent
of its members,—we acknowledge that
such is the fact,—but how are they distributed?—Are
they held out as inducements for
exertion, as the appropriate rewards of diligence
and merit?—By no means:—They are
universally disposed of through the channels
of family influence, or parliamentary interest:—the
minister for the time being (in
the name of his sovereign) has the uncontrouled
disposal of Church dignities, and it is
probable (it might be said notorious) that he
will rather consult how he may best strengthen
his own interest for retaining his situation,
than attend to the characters and qualifications
of the applicants:—it is, by no means,
intended to call in question the methods, by
which the present venerated dignitaries of the
Church arrived at their eminence, their exemplary
conduct proves that they deserve it,
they are beyond dispute, endowed with piety,
learning, and conscientiousness in discharge
of their sacred functions, but will their successors
in office, succeed also to their good
qualities? The future probable consequences
should therefore occupy the attention of
the public;—under such circumstances, the
minister may appoint to these dignities,
men totally destitute of the necessary qualifications;
they, imitating the minister, may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
confer their patronage upon their own immediate
connexions, or upon such fawning sycophants
only as are best versed in flattery and
insinuation;—can a clergy, thus constituted,
command the respect of the people? on the
contrary, they will excite contempt rather
than reverence:—hence may be discerned
the principle of decay in the system, which,
unless guarded against with the utmost vigilance,
threatens to prove fatal:—the Roman
Catholics, swayed by these facts, and their
attendant consequences, hesitated at the
proposal of Emancipation, when clogged
with the Veto;—the clergy foresaw, that in
consequence of the Veto, they would, in fact,
become dependant upon the minister for all
future promotion; the laity were alarmed,
lest the priesthood should be corrupted,
whilst they suspected that, by these means,
the people in general would be demoralized,
Emancipation therefore, upon such terms,
they wisely determined to reject, and they
merit the applause of the public for this their
virtuous determination.—“Ere long” (the
Revd. Author fervently prays) “may there
be prepared and enforced a stronger test
than the articles of religion, to clear our
Parishes and to save our children from the
cruel consequences of Evangelical Instruction,”
(by which expression he is supposed
to mean the errors of fanaticism.) Would he
then, out of pure good will to the Protestants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
enlarge their measure of Faith as already
prescribed by law, and still farther controul
their reason? Is he aware that the defection
of many, even of the Protestant clergy, proceeds
from a repugnance to these articles,
and would he encrease the schism? His
hostility to the sectaries may be reasonably
suspected, when he recommends a mode, so
evidently, tending to increase their numbers.
The Catholics are charged by him, with being
sworn enemies to their Protestant fellow subjects,
he would, notwithstanding, imitate
the conduct he reviles, and render the hostility
between all parties irreconcilable;—he
would, even arm the dignitaries of his Church
with more extensive powers, and convert
those, who ought to be models of Christian
charity, into instruments of unchristian
persecution: but the Rev. Baronet has,
perhaps, a mitre in contemplation, and is
anxious, ere he wields the crozier, that the
office may be invested with more ample
means of exalting the Protestant Ascendancy,
at the expense of all who differ
from its doctrines; It is to be hoped, however,
that, should he arrive at this proud
eminence, he will exercise its present powers,
unaided by additional ones, with temperance
and discretion.</p>

<p>The Public then will cease to wonder that
the Revd. Author should so strongly object
to a right honourable gentleman’s declaration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
in answer to a Catholic Address, viz:
that he is at a loss to account for the reasons
that operate, to prevent the Catholics from
being “unrestrictedly emancipated,” since
this declaration militates against the Protestant
Ascendancy;—with due submission,
however, to the learned Author’s accumulated
Experience (“having, from the earliest
period of his academic course, been in the
habit of devoting a considerable part of
his time in the acquirement of knowledge,
and of informing his mind upon matters
connected with the History, Politics, and
Religions of his country. Having been
accustomed, likewise, to pass such time in
the society of the most eminent and able
Writers, Politicians, and Statesmen, of
ancient and modern days.”) We cannot
but accord with the above stated declaration
of the Right Honorable Gentleman, as equally
just and liberal;—if the co-operation of
the Catholics, as fellow subjects, be expected,
why should they be debarred from the
privileges of the subjects?—If their attachment
to the Constitution be a desirable object,
why not attract them by the united
motives of interest and affection?—But how
can they be interested in, how can they affect
a Constitution, which excludes them, in particular,
from its benefits and confidence?—Notwithstanding,
however, that we acknowledge
the justice and liberality of this declaration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
we must beg leave to express our
dissent from the same Right Honorable
Gentleman, when (according to the Report
of a recent debate) he pretends to define the
term Liberty, by <i>Potestas faciundi quicquid
per leges liceat</i>;—the power of doing whatever
may be permitted by the laws, points
out, only, that peculiar portion of liberty
allowed by each respective Government, to
its appropriate subjects, but can never be
substituted for the general term itself.—In
the Eastern regions, where the Prince is despotic,
where the will of the Sovereign is the
law of the state, the liberty of the subject
will be bounded by the Will of a Tyrant;
under such circumstances the people are
mere slaves;—hence, the Right Honorable
Gentleman’s definition is equally applicable
to Slavery, as to Liberty,—it may, however,
be looked upon as the definition of a lawyer,
and as lawyers, in general, accommodate
their pleadings to the taste and interest of
their clients, it may be presumed, that the
Right Honorable Gentleman adopted his definition
to the interest, and peculiar taste of
his employer:—in the course of his harangue
on the same occasion, the Right Honorable
Gentleman is reported to assert, (if we understand
the report aright,) that the great body
of the people has no right to enter into
discussions concerning civil polity, or the
immediate measures of Government, an assertion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
that does but little credit to his head,
or his heart.—It may incline the people,
however, to examine into the Right Honorable
Gentleman’s own claim to this important
privilege;—it may also be asked, who
are interested in the measures adopted by
administration?—Is it the public at large?
or is it the ministry? The ministers are, indeed,
a part of the people, but a failure in
vigilance, with respect to their own immediate
interests, will never be attributed to them;
the security, the property, the liberty of the
people, are at stake, and it behoves them to
be equally attentive to their concerns:—to
whom are ministers responsible?—to the representatives
of the Nation:—who are the
constituents of this representative body?—the
people:—in order then to estimate the
merits of a candidate, the people should become
competent judges of the excellence of
their own Constitution, and of the qualifications
necessary, in a representative, to watch
over and to maintain its inviolability;—a
close inspection therefore, into the System of
Government, and into the conduct pursued
by their own representatives, is a duty they
owe themselves,—their fellow-subjects, and
their posterity;—the upright senator will
also invite this serenity, whereas the corrupt
fool of a crafty minister will endeavour to
evade enquiry, as in the event of detection,
he contemplates his own disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Neither does the Revd. Author spare
the Radical Reformers, “Who (he says) under
the pretence of Petition, have alone
in view the ascertainment of strength, for
the purposes of desolation.”——that immense
multitudes assembling from all quarters,
with the intent of framing Petitions for
a reform in their representation, is alarming
to the peaceable phlegmatic subject, cannot
be doubted, but it is no less certain that in
general, they conducted themselves on these
occasions, with the utmost tranquillity and
discretion:—if (as he maintains) Government
were armed with sufficient powers to
suppress the meetings, why were they not
resorted to in the first instance? why connive
at such scenes, even in the Metropolis,
where they must undoubtedly be the most
formidable, and thus impress upon the people
an idea of their legality?—Why encourage
a frequent repetition of them, and thus
give occasion for the fatal occurrences at
Manchester?—If it be true that prevention
is better than a cure, were not the Ministers
remiss in not instantly exerting their powers?
and that they had these powers, we have the
Revd. Baronets own authority.—Why, then,
resort to new measures, when the existing
laws were sufficient for the immediate occasion?—A
free Press is generally looked upon
as the surest bulwark against the encroachments
of power; to it also, we are indebted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
for the various improvements in Arts, in
Sciences, and even in virtue and religion,
when considered as Sciences;—the unrestrained
privilege of questioning every proposition,
and discussing every subject, greatly
contributes to the investigation of truth;
should the liberty of the Press, degenerate
into licentiousness, a legal remedy has, long
since been provided;—should it encourage
tumultuous meetings, as the former laws
(according to Sir Harcourt Lees) were of
sufficient force to suppress such assemblies, a
farther restraint was unnecessary, and uncalled
for;—should it disseminate Blasphemy
through the nation, the good sense of
the people will soon reject and condemn it,
as is evident from the several verdicts returned
against the publications of such a nature;—does
then, the Baronet indulge in irony,
when he extols the conduct of administration?
on the contrary, we rather suspect that,
misled by his own voracious appetite for
praise, in too liberally dispensing it to others,
he has unguardedly conveyed censure, where
he meant but to commend.</p>

<p>The liberty of the Press, is without doubt,
liable to abuse, so is every privilege we enjoy,
as men or as subjects, but, if it be once
admitted that the abuse of any privilege by
a few individuals, is a sufficient reason for
withdrawing it from the Public at large, all
their privileges as free men will be successively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
forfeited:—If, indeed, Government
had not been possessed of sufficient means
for remedying the apparent disorders, they
had had a decent apology for resorting to
new measures, and restrictive expedients;
but, when the Revd. Author acknowledges
the competence of the powers vested in Ministers,
originally to suppress such assemblies,
he according to our apprehension,
(though perhaps, not designedly,) censures
their conduct in neglecting to do so.</p>

<p>That seats in the House of Commons, are
to be purchased, is as notorious as the sun
at noon day, according to a noble member
of the present Administration, who is reported,
in the public papers, to have made
use of this expression, on being convicted of
bartering or attempting to barter a seat in
that house, for a Writership in the East
India Service:—it is no less confidently affirmed,
that, in many instances, Boroughs
(intended to return representatives of the
commercial part of the Empire) are become
the properties of private individuals, who
either appoint their own Members (with
this particular proviso, that they shall vacate
their seats, unless they vote agreeably to
the will of the individual appointing them)
or without hesitation sell them to the best
bidder:—it even, sometimes happens, that
the Aristocracy of a county (by which I mean
the proprietors of great landed estates) consult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
together, how many votes each of them
can command (for they conclude that every
tenant must vote according to the direction
of his landlord) and proceed to put in nomination
such candidates, as may have secured the
weightiest interest with themselves, who are
generally successful; whether are they then,
the representatives of the people, or of a
few individuals constituting this Aristocracy?—Are
these practices consistent with the
Constitution? or rather is not its very principle
violated by them?—in consequence of
these abuses, it may reasonably be conjectured,
that the representative body will become
corrupt;—that their own immediate interests
will outweigh all consideration for the public;
and that they will utterly disregard the
rights and privileges of the people, to protect
which, however, they were originally instituted:—are
the people culpable if aroused
by such grievances? they petition for a Reform
in the Commons House, well aware
that the long duration of Parliaments, not
only gives birth to, but accelerates the progress
of corruption; if they aim at an annual,
rather than a septennial parliament, concluding
that, by how much the shorter the period of
their parliamentary existence may be, the
Administration will become by so much the
less able and less willing to corrupt the
members, and that even should any individuals
of the representative body betray their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
trust, the period will soon arrive, in which
they may elect more worthy representatives?—It
has been asserted that this is contrary to
the nature of our boasted constitution; but,
if the system be imperfect in this one particular,
why not amend so material a defect?—Or
is the constitution immutable but for the
benefit of the Aristocracy, whilst every change
is inadmissible, that will protect the people
at large in the due enjoyment of their rights
and privileges?—Is the change from a Triennial,
to a Septennial Parliament (brought
about by the representative body, in direct
violation of their constituents’ rights;) is this
change, it may be asked, less hazardous than
one which purposes only to guard against the
corruption, and to correct those abuses which
have almost imperceptibly crept into the
representation?—As the existence of corruption
in the representative is too probable,
so is its prevalence in the constituent body
too notorious:—election by ballot, it has been
supposed, will provide a remedy against this
evil;—it will remain unknown to the candidates
for whom the voters may poll, the application
of bribery therefore will be ineffectual,
as, notwithstanding his acceptance of a
bribe, the voter may still poll, according to
his inclination or his conscience, without the
fear of a discovery.</p>

<p>In regard to the universal suffrage, it
must be acknowledged that every individual,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
in the state, has an interest in the
proper administration of its affairs, and that
Government will, sometimes, need the support,
even of its meanest subjects; if, therefore,
they are interested in, and contribute
to the support of Government, they are entitled
to a participation in its privileges;—the
privilege they claim is the Elective Franchise,
and as the lower house is called the
Commons House of Parliament, why should
not the members, instead of representing
property, be in fact the representatives of the
People?—At the same time such material
changes adopted on a sudden, might produce
tumult and disorder, they might occasion
convulsions, attended with far more dreadful
effects, than the evils they purpose to remedy;—but
when a minister acknowledges corruption
in his own conduct;—when the sale
of Boroughs is notoriously practised;—when,
in some instances, the representatives of a
County are returned by the influence alone
of a few powerful individuals;—when the
late convictions, in the House of Commons,
for bribery, prove that it is frequently, if not
generally practised by the candidates for seats
in that house, and that it has a pernicious
influence upon the constituent body;—it cannot
be disputed, but that some remedy ought
instantly to be applied, in order to eradicate,
or at least to check the wide spreading infection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Lord Grey, Lord Grenville, the Whig
party, even the members of the opposition
are collectively abused by this Author; Lord
Grey and Lord Grenville, however, together
with many other individuals whom he severely
censures, are men of acknowledged talents
and information, as is evident from their general
conduct, and the speeches they have
delivered in various Parliamentary debates;
but they differ in opinion from his Reverence,
if however, every man, who thinks differently
from the learned Author, be a profligate
or a blockhead, we suspect that, besides
himself, he will scarcely find a wise or a
virtuous individual throughout the great
Empire.</p>

<p>He again resumes his attacks upon the
Catholics, we shall, however, in the first instance,
notice three questions, one particle of
which he so confidently defies them to refute:</p>

<p>1st. “Does not a Papist kneel down before,
pray and bow to images, pictures, and pieces
of old wood representing our Blessed Saviour,
the Virgin Mary, and many Saints, and does
he not do this for the purpose either of paying
adoration to these identical pieces of
wood, old sheets of oil cloth, with faces
smeared on them, almost as hideous as most
of those you will see at the Catholic Board,
on reading one of Robert Peele’s Anti-catholic
speeches, or to their likenesses?”—In answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
to this question we beg leave to refer
to the catechisms of the catholics, in which
occur the following questions and answers:—Is
it lawful to adore the blessed Virgin or
the saints?—No: for by adoration is here
meant the honor due to God alone.—Do the
commandments forbid us to honor the
Saints?—No: for the honor we give them is
different from that which we pay to God, we
honor the Saints as friends and faithful servants
to God.—If it is forbid in Catholics to
worship the Saints, can it be supposed that
they will pay adoration to their image, pictures
or representations?—Or, is it consistent
with probability that the same Church will
direct them, in their riper years, to practise,
what it has taught them when pupils, to reject
and avoid?—The council of Trent has,
without doubt, declared, that due honor and
respect be given to images of Christ, the Virgin
Mary, and the other Saints;—and who
can deny that that degree of honor and respect,
to which they are entitled, should be
paid these, or any other representations?—It
is natural to be affected at the Representation
of a dear departed friend and benefactor;
the Catholics look upon them as their
best of benefactors, they therefore pay them
a due degree of honor and respect, should
they, however, exceed this degree, they are
not only culpable, but obnoxious likewise,
to the censures of their own Church:—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Protestants themselves regard King William
III. as their benefactor, of course they honor
and drink to his memory, some even have
been so far inflamed with enthusiasm, as to
drink to his glorious and immortal memory
on their bare knees, are not these Protestants
equally idolatrous with the Catholics?</p>

<p>Secondly, “He wishes to know whether a
Papist does not pray to Saints and Angels,
and invoke their intercession, thereby making
Gods, not only of Angels, but even
of dead men, although expressly informed,
by God himself, that there is but one mediator
with the Father, not only of redemption
but of intercession also, which is our
blessed Saviour, and in doing so is he not
guilty of idolatry?” That the Roman Catholics
intreat of Saints and Angels to forward
petitions in their behalf, for obtaining
the divine mercy, is acknowledged, but that,
in doing so, they mean to worship them as
Gods, or to incur the guilt of idolatry, is as
confidently denied:—they dread through an
humble confidence of their own demerits,
to offer from themselves an immediate address
to the Deity:—and as Christ himself
has given an example of praying for others,
even his persecutors, in those memorable
words, “Pardon them O Lord, for they know
not what they do;” so the Catholics may
probably imagine that the Saints and Angels
whom they address, will petition in their behalf,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and as they are pure in comparison with
themselves, these petitions will have greater
effect, than the immediate addresses of a
polluted sinner—we think also, that the answer
to the first, is a sufficient answer to this
question.</p>

<p>Thirdly, “He is induced to enquire whether
a Papist does not pay divine adoration
to a mixture of flour and water, made up
by the hands of an illiterate and possibly
profligate priest, contrary to the figurative
sense and meaning of the Holy Scripture,
and in direct opposition to reason and common
understanding? does he not believe
that a Popish Priest has the power of
making a God? and does he not bow down
and worship this worse than golden image?”—It
may be asked the Revd. Baronet if he
ever enquired before administering the holy
Communion to his own flock, whether the
bread provided for the purpose, were made
by pure and undefiled hands, whether the
wine were genuine, or brewed by some rascally
vintner;—and is not the term profligate,
equally applicable to a minister of the
establishment, as to a Popish Priest, particularly,
if the minister devotes much of his
time to the joys of the chase, and (we may
naturally suppose) its consequent festivity;
whilst the Priest is laboriously and almost
constantly employed in the conscientious
discharge of his sacred functions? as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
adoration paid to the Host, the Catholic believes
that the Body and Blood of Christ
(acknowledged to partake of the Godhead)
are actually present, and can he justly be
called idolatrous for paying adoration to the
presence of Divinity?—the learned gentleman
may also be requested to explain what
he means to impress upon the mind of a Catechumen,
by the following words: “the
Body and Blood of Christ are verily and indeed
taken and received by the faithful in
the Lord’s Supper.”—Let it be understood,
that we by no means, recommend these doctrines,
they may possibly give occasion of
offence to such tender consciences as the Baronet
possesses, they are matters of belief,
and therefore left to every man’s own determination;—since,
however, some particles of
his questions have been absolutely and with
truth denied, whilst others have been so far
answered, we hope, as to exculpate the Catholics
from all criminality either in act or
intention, we may conclude, that should a
Cardinal’s hat be now engaged to the Revd.
Baronet, he will perhaps, not only be almost,
but altogether inclined to renounce his own
faith, and turn Papist.</p>

<p>In treating of the monstrous doctrines ascribed
by Sir Harcourt Lees to the Catholics,
we may premise that their own general conduct
sufficiently refutes his accusation:—his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
strong assertions however, may seem to demand
some farther enquiry.</p>

<p>The 4th Lateran council was held in the
year 1215, at which were present, most of the
christian sovereigns;—this council therefore
may be properly termed a general congress
of the temporal, as well as spiritual Powers of
Christendom; they assembled for the purpose
of suppressing the heresy of the Manchæans,
or Albigenses, whose doctrines
were (according to Mosheim) not only subversive
of morality, decency, and good order,
but even destructive to the human species,—it
was supported by the Counts of
Thoulouse, Cominges, Foix, and aided by
numerous bodies of banditti, hired for this
purpose.—The heresy was condemned by the
spiritual authority of the church; and the
Fiefs of the princes encouraging it, were declared
forfeitures to their liege lords, by the
authority of the sovereigns, there assembled:—the
censures of this council or rather
congress were never promulgated, and scarcely
known in this island, but were directed
(we believe, solely) against the Manchæans
or Albigenses, and the princes above mentioned,
who encouraged and protected the votaries
of this pernicious heresy.</p>

<p>The council of Constance, held in the
year 1414, expressly declares that it is heretical
to affirm it lawful for a subject to kill
his prince, on any pretence whatsoever, session<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
15. One solitary instance of the contrary
doctrine being maintained, occurs in Mariana,
whose book was condemned, and
publicly burnt by a provincial council of her
own order; this Mariana was a Spaniard,
born at Talavera, in the year 1537, who became
a Religious in the year 1554;—he
was also condemned by the parliament of
Paris, and by the doctors of Sorbonne, and
his book burnt by the hands of the common
hangman.</p>

<p>The council of Trent assembled in the year
1545, and continued to the year 1563, declares,
that to violate the least point of public faith
given to heretics, is a crime punishable by
the laws of God and Man; session, 15 and
18. The doctrine then of the Catholics teaches
them that no power on earth can absolve
them from allegiance to their sovereigns and
civil magistrates, and obliges them to keep
faith with all men:—when therefore, the
Revd. Author asserts, that according to the
4th Lateran council, oaths taken contrary to
the interest of the Popish church are not to
be called oaths, but perjuries, and that it is
still in force, we must question the accuracy
of his information, in regard to its being a
received doctrine among the catholics;—the
council of Constance, and subsequently the
council of Trent decreed the very reverse,
and the doctrine of the last general council
must now be like the prevailing one:—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
oaths taken by the priests and Bishops regard
only spirituals, that part which refers
to the Rights, Honors, State and Power of
the Pope is confined (as the Catholics assert)
to such as live under the Pope’s temporal
jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction of a Catholic
Sovereign;—Our own sovereigns are bound
(the author proceeds) by the coronation oath
“to the utmost of their power to maintain
the true profession of the gospel,” but by
gospel, we are enjoined to do unto all men
as we would they should do unto us; persecution
therefore, in the slightest degree, is
a departure from this precept,—“and the
Protestant reformed religion as established
by the laws”—whether will the Protestant
Religion be better maintained by an observance
of, or a deviation from, the doctrine contained
in the Gospel? “to preserve the Bishops
and Clergy of this Realm, and to the
churches committed to their charge, all
such rights and privileges as by law, do or
shall appertain to them, or any of them,”
Catholic Emancipation will not encroach
upon these rights and privileges, it will only
procure an equal participation of civil rights
and privileges for the Catholics, which in
compliance with the Gospel, the Protestants
are bound to grant, as they in a like situation,
would wish to obtain the same privileges
for themselves.</p>

<p>As Sir Harcourt Lees is so very liberal in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
his application of censure upon individuals,
upon Parties, upon Sects, who may differ
from himself in opinion, with respect to the
three natural points which concern human
Life, Religion, Morals and Politics, we presume
that he bears in mind and accords with
the assertion of Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “that all men
are, by nature, prone to delight in detraction
and invective,” but that, through the
multiplicity of his studious pursuits, the remainder
of the sentence, in which this assertion
is contained, has entirely escaped his recollection,
“but to be disgusted with those
who praise themselves,” as he is no less liberal
in self Commendation;—The Athenian
Orator indeed recounts to his Audience the
services he had rendered the State, during
his Administration, but handsomely, apologizes
for this conduct, by premissing that he
was obliged to pursue this method, in order
to refute the Calumnies of his Adversary, and
that therefore the odium, naturally attendant
upon self Praise, ought to rest upon the Individual,
who had compelled him to bring forward
such a Relation: Sir Harcourt Lees,
however had no adversary to contend with;
no one disputed his merits; of course he had
no Calumnies to refute; we must conclude
therefore, that he expects some material Reward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
for his present and former Exertions,
and therefore points out his peculiar claims
lest they should remain unknown and extinguished;
his success we wish not to prevent;
our aim is to guard the Public (since men are
naturally inclined to delight in censure) from
imbibing prejudice through the agreeable
medium of invective.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>
</div>

<p>To give advice, without giving offence, is
a serious difficulty;—it has been pertinently
observed, that to give advice is to seize an
occasion of displaying our own wisdom, at
the expence of others, and however readily
a superiority in all other respects, may be
admitted, the assumption of superior sense
and understanding is universally offensive;
the learned Baronet has made a pompous
display of his diligence, his research, his
consequent information, and urges his claim
to attention, from the mortifying circumstance
of our inferiority in understanding,
when compared with his own:—making no
pretensions to superiority of intellect, claiming
only the free exercise of reason and common
sense, and suspecting that some ingredients
in the Rev. Baronet’s prescription
(should it be adopted) might prove injurious
to the general system; We are anxious to
preserve the constitution sound and vigorous,
and being members of the public, we look
upon ourselves as included in the number
of patients, we shall therefore take the liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
without further ceremony, of examining
(as far as we can understand it) into the
composition of his Antidote.</p>

<p>The Revd. Author thus expresses himself:
“to the superintending care of an energetic,
firm, and most popular administration, I
with confident security resign the civil and
constitutional difference of my country;
the established government in state, may
in such hands be saved from destruction;”
we must beg leave in this particular, to dissent
from his prescription (of which we deem
this an ingredient, since he recommends it
by the authority of his own example) as,
however energetic, firm, popular, and even
strenuously devoted to public liberty the
present ministers may be, they are but men,
of course liable to error and assailable by
the temptations of power and interest we
would, on the contrary, recommend a jealous
vigilance with respect to every measure of
every administration;—the immediate interests
of a minister may be distinct from those
of the people, he may therefore, in some
instances be induced to sacrifice all considerations
for the public good, to the prevailing
motives of avarice and ambition:—and
here we will repeat our dissent from a
Right Honorable Gentleman, should he have
asserted (which however, we gather only from
a News-paper report) that the people have
no right to enter into discussions concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
civil Polity in general, or the immediate
measures of government; his legal experience
we presume, will inform him that a
Trustee is accountable for the proper management
of his trust;—both the executive
and legislative bodies are trustees of the
people, to whom they are responsible, for
the due discharge of the sacred trust reposed
in them; the more they enquire into the effects
resulting from the measures of every
administration, the more competent will they
become in appreciating the merits of their
respective trustees, and the more clearly will
they discern the propriety of conferring upon,
or withholding from them their farther confidence.</p>

<p>He considers “unrestricted Emancipation
to be impossible, so long as the Constitution
in Church and State shall be Protestant”
and asserts “that the necessity of excluding
Papists from Parliament, and from
the great offices of State, is imperious, in
order to preserve both from destruction.”
Neither can we subscribe to this opinion of
the Revd. Author;—We have endeavored
to prove (and hope with success) that the
Authorities he quotes are unfounded, or obsolete
and at present of no force:—an equal
Participation in the same rights and privilege
produces union and harmony, even among
those who, from the circumstance of receiving
different educations, may have imbibed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
different religious tenets; whilst a partial preference,
and distinct privileges annexed to
the profession of a particular faith, encourage
the growth of jealousy and discussion:—<i>Divide
and impera</i> is the boasted maxim of a
crooked policy;—a well constituted Government
consults for, and endeavours to promote
the common welfare of all its subjects:—what
have been the measures of policy
pursued with regard to Ireland? The bulk
of its population is Catholic, and has during
a century groaned under the arbitrary sway
of a Protestant Government, partial to professors
of its own faith, and arming them
with distinct privileges;—the Catholics have
been subject to an Oligarchy, composed of
their declared opponents;—they have been
debarred from acquiring real property;—their
Estates have been liable to confiscation, for
refusing to swear contrary to their consciences;—they
have been restricted in the free exercise
of their religion, and from educating
their children in that faith which they esteemed
the true one;—can it be expected,
that these circumstances should attach them
to the constitution? they acknowledge its excellence,
and that its subjects enjoy a greater
portion of liberty, than the subjects of any
other state in Europe;—they look upon
themselves, however, not as its subjects, but
its slaves:—instead of interminable hostility
against the Catholics, we would earnestly recommend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
conciliation;—let them be once
admitted to all the privileges of subjects, they
will (we dare affirm) become equally zealous
in their attachment to the Constitution, as
the Protestant himself.—In maintaining the
contrary opinion, we regret that the Revd.
Sir Harcourt Lees, should forget his character
as a gentleman and a scholar, for, however
he may vent his spleen in gross and vulgar
abuse, a sinner against good-breeding, and
the laws of decency will no more be esteemed
a good author, than will a sinner against
grammar, good argument, or good sense.</p>

<p>He is scarcely less abusive in his animadversions
upon the Fanatics or Evangelical,
and if they, in reality, maintain such tenets
as he attributes to them, we must acknowledge
that they are objectionable; they tend
to diminish the general benevolence of mankind,
and to render them regardless of moral
rectitude; but persecution is still more dangerous,
and in proposing a strong test, in addition
to the Thirty-nine Articles he seems
actuated, in some measure, by a spirit of persecution;
even Bishop Burnet (whose orthodox
we presume will not be disputed) confesses
that the requiring subscription to the Thirty
nine Articles, is a great imposition:—and,
would you, Revs. Sir, impose a more grievous
test of orthodoxy?—be assured, that the
strength of your test, and its embracing a
multitude of objects will not tend to confirm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
your establishment:—it may and probably
will flourish, in power and wealth, with the
government of which it forms a part, but the
superior excellence of the doctrines you profess,
your own exemplary deportment in private
life, together with a zealous exertion in
the discharge of your sacred functions, will
also render its influence extensive, or its duration
permanent:—here we would recommend
(but with the utmost deference and
humility) the co-operation of Government,—were
the gradations in preferment allotted to
gradations in merit,—were the dignities of
the Church, exclusively, appropriated to eminence
in virtue, piety, learning, the clergy in
early life would be stimulated to exertion for
the attainment of these good qualities, their
exertions would, in general, be crowned with
success, and thus, at a more advanced period,
they would become illustrious ornaments to
their profession; whilst the people instructed
by the impressive exhortations, and influenced
by the upright conduct of their clergy,
would be far more inclined to the practise of
morality and good-order.</p>

<p>In regard to the radical reformers, their
views may possibly be directed to tumult and
anarchy, but the ostensible object of their
contemplation do not appear to us visionary
and impracticable, such material changes, however,
admitted at once into the system, might
be attended with danger and convulsion, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
wilt by no means venture to deny that it
might be so, yet Burnet (zealously devoted
to Government in his time) recommends the
annual Election of Representatives as an effectual
expedient to stem the progress of corruption,
which had, even then, made great
inroads among all ranks of people: Election
by ballot would defeat all the purposes which,
at present, induce many of the candidates to
resort to bribery; whilst universal suffrage
would disable them from tampering with all
the voters:—corruption has moreover in
some instances, and at some periods, insinuated
itself into the representative body;—the
expediency of reform, therefore, can be no
longer doubtful;—and that reform is necessary,
the most eminent characters in our
Empire have, long since, acknowledged, they
have likewise on several occasions attempted
to introduce it;—whilst Foreigners contemplating
the excellence of the British Constitution,
and enumerating the beneficial consequences,
resulting to the several Nations
of Europe, from the example of a free and independent
State, flourishing among themselves,
have deeply lamented the existence
of a vice in the system, which must gradually
undermine it;—O Honte (says Raynal)
l’Homme riche achete les suffrages de ses
Commettans, pour obtenir l’Honneur de les
representer; la Cour achete les suffrages des
Representans gouverner plus despotiquement;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
une Nation sage ne travailleroit elle
pas a prevenir l’une &amp; l’autre corruption?
N’est il pas etonnant que cela ne se soit pas
fait, le jour qu’un Representant eut l’impudence
de faire attendre ses Commettans dans
son Antichambre, &amp; de leur dire ensuite, je
ne sais ce que vous voulez, mais je n’en ferai
qu’a ma tete; je vous ai achetés fort cher, &amp; j’ai
bien resolu de vous vendre le plus cher que
je pourrai:—we here confidently recommend
a radical reform in ourselves, for the
purpose of insuring to the body politic a
sound and perfect recovery—Let every member
of the state correct his own vices—and
the voters should not only correct themselves;
but it is their duty to examine into
the qualifications which can entitle a candidate
to their approbation;—is he frugal in
his expences without meanness?—is he liberal,
without profusion or ostentation?—is his
private life marked by no destructive vice?—they
may safely conclude that such a representative,
unassailable by corruption, will discharge
his trust with fidelity.</p>

<p>In consequence of the demise of our
late and regretted Monarch, the period
is at hand when the people will have a
legal opportunity of freely and openly expressing
their sentiments, in regard to the
measures lately adopted by Administration;—if,
in their opinion, the good and loyal
subject is farther protected, by these means,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
in the unmolested enjoyment of his rights
and privileges;—if the cottage of the meanest
peasant still remains his castle, from
which he may legally repel all violent intrusion;—if
the Press restrained only in its licentiousness,
is confirmed in the full exercise of
its liberty (the great Bulwark of the British
Constitution)—then will their former members,
who supported such enactments, be returned
to Parliament, as deserving objects of
their preference:—but should they think that
encroachments on civil liberty are substituted
as safeguards to the Constitution;—that
the habitation of every British subject is exposed,
even, to nightly visitations, at the capricious
will of a Magistrate;—that the liberty
of the Press is essentially violated, under
a specious pretext of correcting its
abuses, and preventing the dissemination of
blasphemous and seditious libes;—the people
will be aroused to a consideration of the
danger impending over themselves, and
therefore be cautious in their choice of Representatives;—in
either case, however, we finally
recommend inviolable abstinence from
corruption:—Let no views of present emolument,
no promises of further patronage,—let
neither threats, nor intreaties prevail on
you to depart from the conscientious discharge
of your duty as voters:—the corruption
of the constituent, will serve as an apology
for the corruption of the Representative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
body:—exhibit in yourselves a generous example
of reform:—your Representatives,
chosen for the good qualities you have discerned
in them, will copy the example and
thus will the pernicious disorder, preying upon
your very vitals, be in some measure
checked, if not entirely eradicated from your
constitution.</p>

<p>We have thus far obtruded upon the Public,
in consequence of our objections to the
Antidote of Sir Harcourt Lees, and conclude
with an anxious wish that, whatever application
may be adopted by them, it may most
conduce to the advancement of civil and religious
liberty, and may best contribute to the
present and future welfare of the people.</p>
